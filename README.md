and exporting digital editions of piano roll. In particular it allows to:

  - import piano rolls from different formats (such
    as SUPRA's roll analysis files, DSP, etc.)
  - collate differing piano roll copies
  - create an manipulate editorial assumptions 
  - export the edition as JSON-LD (based on the 
    linked-rolls ontology)
